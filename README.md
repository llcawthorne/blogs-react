# blogs-react #

This is just a place for me to keep sample code from blogposts that I follow along with. I've separated Java blogposts into three categories. blogs-java, blogs-jee, and blogs-spring. I've also made a blogs-clojure repo for when I follow along with clojure blogs, and I've added a blogs-scala too. I'm still unsure about kotlin outside new gradle buildscripts with IDE support (which sound awesome), but I'll create a blogs-kotlin too.  I read blogs on a lot of different topics, but I haven't been saving all my work. Hopefully with the projects in one place, I'll have a reliable way to refresh my memory about something I read once.

I've been doing one repo per course when following along with courses, but this is simply unsustainable with blogposts, since there are so many.  I've also added blogs-angular for Angular blog exercises I follow, blogs-react for react examples, and a more general blogs-javascript for other javascript themed exercises.  I think React stuff will just go in blogs-javascript for now, since I don't focus on it too much.
